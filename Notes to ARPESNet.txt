Things that could be looked at:
    Have there ever been a discusion about using reinforsed learning to futher minimise the big differences and rewarding it for creating a more uniformly spread.

    The ARPESNet creates (probaly) better results, but is it better and faster than a simple denoiser algorithm.


Tager de for meget data.
